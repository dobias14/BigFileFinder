- Technical Specification

The outcome is an APK application
The successful solution also includes functional source codes that are easy to compile (Android project), description of selected solution and development resources used.
The application may be tested in the development environment simulator, i.e. it is not necessary to own an Android phone.

- Input

Number of files (N) the user wishes to find.
Dynamic list of directories where the files shall be searched for (possibility to add and take away directories before the search).

- Output

Output is the list of N biggest files including the size and full path.

- Evaluation

The following will be evaluated:
Functionality of application.
Effectiveness (memory, speed), the programming techniques and structures used.

Source code quality and software design of the solution.

- Bonus:

Good-looking and functional Android UI.
Possibility of parallel search in case directories are located on various physical media, i.e. internal vs. external SD card.

- Tools

For Android platform, it is possible to use any SDK (4.0 and higher).
